--- PROJECT WIDE ---
--------------------

TODO

- Not totally sure how to map commands. If they're in a separate file, then requires need to be
done for everything. Maybe use defer require?
- Maybe put all keymaps into one file so only one needs to be required. Perhaps also think about
when certain maps need to be required at all
- Any load behavior needs to be checked against mksession
- I think we use qQ as our view or jump, rather than q<C-q>. Merge the two in nav action and stack
- I have the maps file as a separate file for now simply for sanity, but in order to save a
require it might be best to just put it in plugin.lua
- Purely internal stuff should not involve error handling
- Create a way to send the quickfix list to a normal buffer, and allow specifying which elements you want to bring over. Found this use case when trying to move over todo list stuff
- Make a way to copy lists. The filter code should mostly get you there
- Make the autoopen changes var actually do something
- Should be able to control if you want your regex to be case sensitive or not. Would be good alt
maps but compatibilty and such
- Document what regex is used where. Ext programs use their regex. Filter stuff uses vim regex
- In general, titling is weak
- When grepping specific buf to replace, get error invalid $chistory. Bad buf numbering
- When everything is actually in the final directory structure, do one last check to make sure no eager requires happen

---------------------
--- DOCUMENTATION ---
---------------------

- The filter provides a replacement for the cfilter plugin, so that no longer needs to be added
- The cn/cpfile logic does not have the same level of wrapping logic as the cc wrapper
- The open functions double as resizers, as per the built-in cmd behavior

-------------------
--- DIAGNOSTICS ---
-------------------

TODO

- Check that all functions have reasonable default sorts
- Check that window height updates are triggered where appropriate
- Check that functions have proper visibility
- Check that all mappings have plugs and cmds
- Check that all maps/cmds/plugs have desc fieldss
- Check that all functions have annotations and documentation
- Check that the qf and loclist versions are both properly built for purpose. Should be able to use the loclist function for buf/win specific info

MAYBE

- You could allow passing win and buf options so this option could be called in scripts, but that creates complexities around how you prioritize the different options. Omitting since for now this is a hypothetical use case
- Ideas for ctrl+diag_type mappings:
    - Min severity + sort by type > lnum (sort maps already exist though)
    - Use the diag type as the max severity

LOW

- Print specific "no diagnostics" messages based on the opts

PERF

- The diagnostic severities are mapped when the raw diags are converted, then de-mapped when sorting. Would be faster to not map initially, then do a mapping pass after sorting

--- FILTER ---
--------------

TODO

- The wrapper function should not be public
- Check that all functions have reasonable default sorts
- Check that window height updates are triggered where appropriate
- Check that functions have proper visibility
- Check that all mappings have plugs and cmds
- Check that all maps/cmds/plugs have desc fieldss
- Check that all functions have annotations and documentation
- Check that the qf and loclist versions are both properly built for purpose. Should be able to use the loclist function for buf/win specific info
- Filter dotfiles/hidden files
- Filter on diagnostic severity
- The regex maps should be on ctrl like grep. And then caps can be case sensitive
- TODO: Improve title
- Should work in visual/cmd mode on a range. Can highlight a word or phrase or whatever
- It would be good to outline the looping logic, since it's the same in basically every function, but I don't know how to make the predicate table work because it's unique to each one, and you can't just like do it the first time because it's per item. I suppose you could store the table externally and then do like a thing that takes in the predicate function, new items, whatever. But it creates a rather tacky "helper" function that takes in a lot of data from the caller
- For the public API, show making diagnostic filters as examples

LOW

- Filter anything without a line/col number

DOCUMENT

- Filter smartcase respects the smartcase opt
- If no count is entered, the current list will be replaced with the filtered list. If a count
is specified, a new, replacement, or add list will be created at the count as specified. The
source list for the filter is always the current one

TODO

- When doing qq inside of a location list, fails on validate

--- GREP ---

TODO

- Check that all functions have reasonable default sorts
- Check that window height updates are triggered where appropriate
- Check that functions have proper visibility
- Check that all mappings have plugs and cmds
- Check that all maps/cmds/plugs have desc fieldss
- Check that all functions have annotations and documentation
- Check that the qf and loclist versions are both properly built for purpose. Should be able to use the loclist function for buf/win specific info
- For the title, use the base command without the specific files/dirs being searched
- The current code does not properly handle ctrl c input canceling
- Need a way to make cmds work. Rough template:
-- Qgrep/Lgrep
-- new/add/replace (no option is add)
-- buf/help/cwd
- Partly a documentation thing and partly a code thing, more clarity around when smartcase is used. Do we have a control for smartcase vs case insensitive?
- If a grep command is run with '<'> marks, those positions should be used to do the grep. Really should apply to any set of marks
- what what grepprg you're using in the prompt

MAYBE

- Smart/ignore case can be rolled under the same option for grepprgs that don't
support it

FUTURE

- Potentially use rg's built-in globbing, allowing for the cmd literal to be used in the title

PERF

- Is it necessary to check the executable status of the grepprg every time?

- Check that the qf and loclist versions are both properly built for purpose. Should be able to use the loclist function for buf/win specific info
- Make the maps file navigable
- I think putting everything in one file is the simplest way to avoid perf issues, but for
individual groups of maps, hide what is possible behind autocmds rather than doing all maps
eagerly on startup

MAYBE

For opening the lists, there are two ideas you could integrate:
- If there are no active lists, the list doesn't open
- If you open to a blank list, it will automatically find a non-blank one
Because the first one is such a big change from the default behavior, it would have to be
behind an option. Also a really bad place to make mistakes in the code. Still, worth
considering if opening blank lists becomes too much of a nag
For the second, would need to work with chistory/lhistory more to know if it's a good idea

- Allow customizing where the qflist opens. But since botright is the default, and a good
one, leaving as is

- Use more function composition without the module

LOW

- Make get_list_height work without nowrap

PERF

- Depending on which functiosn go together, might pull win views twice

--- NAV ACTION ---

TODO

- Check that window height updates are triggered where appropriate

- Check that all maps/cmds/plugs have desc fieldss
- Check that all functions have annotations and documentation
- Check that the qf and loclist versions are both properly built for purpose. Should be able to use the loclist function for buf/win specific info

- Hold on refactoring the jump functions until I know what we're doing with them. Still need to figure out how they co-exist with the qQ mapping
- If you do [q]q on an empty list, it enter errors

- Don't pass in the cmd_parts function. Just pass in the cmd parts
