-- LOW: If you have this sequence
-- 2022
-- 2023
-- 2024
-- And you visually select it then press C-a/C-x, it increments everything in the sequence and
-- leave it de-selected. Is this triggering speeddating behavior of Nvim's built-in behavior? Is
-- there a way to map this with gv so it can be used repeatedly?
