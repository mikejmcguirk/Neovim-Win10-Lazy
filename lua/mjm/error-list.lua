--- FUTURE: Create updated quickfixtextfunc

------------------
-- CAPABILITIES --
------------------

--- GLOBAL CHECKLIST:
--- - Do all functions have a reasonable default sort?
--- - Are window height updates triggered where appropriate?
--- - Are the public/"private exposed"/private settings correct?
--- - Does everything have a plug?
--- - Do maps and plugs have desc fields?
--- - Are all functions fully annotated?

--- TODO: More visibility for cdo/cfdo. Use bang by default?
--- TODO: Resize cmd
--- TODO: Copy list. no count = to next. Count = after list
--- TODO: If the list is already open, an open command should not trigger a re-size. I had ideas
--- about this in other commands, but a manual resize should just be triggered
--- TODO: Have some kind of shortcut to make the list taller. Make sure it preserves view
---     Was thinking qq for toggle, qQ for resize, maybe q<c-Q> to make bigger?
--- TODO: Go thorugh this file and get all old functionalities. Need wrap commands and
--- state management. Note history should adjust height
--- Maybe grep shouldn't be e, because deleting lists is going to be a common op, probably need
--- qe and le to be available.  qd suks. ll sucks.  qt and lt not that great.
--- A reversal of this though is that if you have qie as diag errors, then accidently doing qe
--- would be unfortunate. It might be relevant to put qd as the map and then not map anything
--- else to d
--- Feels roughly like qd for delete current/count list and qD to delete all. But also a potential
--- fat finger. Maybe have separate keys for current and specific lists
--- TODO: look at the issue/PR lists for the various qf plugins to see what people want

--- MAYBE: Should open/close cmds also run wincmd =?
--- MAYBE: Incremental preview of cdo/cfdo changes
--- MAYBE: General cmd parsing: https://github.com/niuiic/quickfix.nvim
--- MAYBE: Publish qf items as diagnostics
---     Semi related, but it would be cool to run make or a test and have the diagnostics publish
---
--- MAYBE: https://github.com/Zeioth/compiler.nvim
--- MAYBE: https://github.com/ahmedkhalf/project.nvim
--- MAYBE: https://github.com/stevearc/overseer.nvim

--- DOCUMENT: Buf greps use external grep
--- DOCUMENT: qf Buf Grep is all bufs, ll Buf Grep is current buf only
--- DOCUMENT: rg handles true multi-line greps. For programs that don't, or is used as a fallback

--------------
-- STAYAWAY --
--------------

--- No attaching to buffers/creating persistent state
--- No modifying buffers within the qflist
--- No additional context type stuff. Previewer covers this
--- No Fuzzy finding type stuff. FzfLua does this
--- No annotations. Should be able to filter down to key items
--- Dynamic behavior. Trouble has to create a whole async runtime and data model to manage this
--- "Modernizing" the feel of the qflist. The old school feel is part of the charm

--------------
-- MAPPINGS --
--------------

--- GENERAL BUFFER MAPS
--- view count of lists
--- goto list number (unimpaired already does cycling)
--- something like qd and qD for cdo and cfdo
--- A way to copy lists, and maybe filtered copy
--- A merge kinda like deep table extend where duplicates are filtered
--- Or a merge that works like a XOR
--- Some of these more complex ideas feel more like commands
---
--- show current stack nr (chistory/lhistory)
--- stack nr statusline component?
---
--- QF BUFFER:
--- p to toggle preview
--- vim-qf-preview has some reasonable maps (r mainly) for previewer

-- Other source notes --
------------------------

-- The vimgrep code is in quickfix.c. Functions often start with "vgr"

local M = {}

----------------
--- Autocmds ---
----------------

-- MAYBE: If you want to be fancy, for each of these qf open/close commands, you could have
-- a generalized function for win_check, and pass in function handlers for different wintype
-- conditions. Would allow for customization. But for the current case, I think the layers of
-- wrappers would add complexity

-- FUTURE: View adjustments should take into account scrolloff and screenlines so that if the
-- user re-enters the window, it doesn't shift to meet scrolloff requirements
-- screenpos() ?
-- screenrow() ?

-- TODO: There should be a setting for whether or not to turn these autocmds on
--- @type integer
-- local loclist_group = vim.api.nvim_create_augroup("loclist-group", { clear = true })

-- Start each window with a fresh loclist
-- vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd("WinNew", {
--     group = loclist_group,
--     pattern = "*",
--     callback = function() vim.fn.setloclist(0, {}, "f") end,
-- })

-- TODO: This does not work when the llist is the last window. Maybe purge and bufdel
-- update - Use protected close
-- Clean up orphaned loclists
-- vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd("WinClosed", {
--     group = loclist_group,
--     callback = function(ev)
--         local win = tonumber(ev.match) --- @type number?

--         if config.relative and config.relative ~= "" then return end

--         local buftype = vim.api.nvim_get_option_value("buftype", { buf = buf }) --- @type string
