--- TODO ---
------------

- Try mapping <C-c> to escape in replace mode so that we don't accidently input those literal characters
- Create keymappings to open and close tabs. Cannot use <M-tab> because windows
- Look into how to autogenerate vimdoc
- Remove all <C-s> and <M-s> mappings
- Mini.operators has a check for seeing if keymaps exist. Use that for the LSP deletes, and wherever else it's appropriate
- Test the highlighter failure issue again. Can see breakage in global_settings.lua, but need updated minimal repro. Wrap setting has more info
- Figure out a "leader" mapping that can be used in insert mode
- Create a diagnostic settings mapping to show errors only or top severity only
- A \ map to show config status
- Move getting top severity to the updated function
- Add --- as a valid lua comment string
- Create mappings for comment headings
- Look for any get_var code and use the built-in dict accessors
- Figure out how to open FzfLua in a vsplit
- Look into how to make the built-in LSP commands always send to the qflist. Looks like there's an
"on list" opt that handles this
- The gW LSP map feels like it can be mapped to grw instead. Opens up the gw/gW namespace for other things
- Do more testing on lockmarks/Conform behavior
- tmux-navigation does not work in FzfLua prompt buffers
- Test lazy tab mappings with mksession
- Look into how the jump list works, including options, so we can customize what types of jumps add to it. Obvious
example - j/k jumps over a certain length should go into the jumplist
- After mapping FzfLua to gi, where do the default gi/gI mappings go? What about my custom screenlinewise start of line mapping?
- Why do I get cmdline flicker if I do it before entering the first real buf? Was thinking its the onCmdLine maps, but it doesn't happen if you do it for the first time in a real buf
- Move Fugitive to gg mappings

- Get a C LSP for reading code
- SSH Clipboard config - https://github.com/tjdevries/config.nvim/blob/master/plugin/clipboard.lua

--- LOW ---

- Look into why [s]s works in some buffer types but not others. Is this configuable?
- Why do Semantic Tokens not trigger properly after LazyDev does a workspace update?
- Unwind lazy plugin loading where possible

--- FUTURE ---
--------------

- Look into emmylua

- Fix the "missing fields" errors in the nvim_cmd keysets
